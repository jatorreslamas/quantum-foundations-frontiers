# 🧠 Quantum Foundations & Frontiers

This repository is a curated library of foundational and modern papers in quantum physics.  
It reflects a personal journey that began at age 13, studying physics independently, and evolved into a structured exploration of the ideas that shaped the quantum world.

## 📚 Structure

This repository is powered by [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/), enabling:

- Sidebar navigation by category and chronology
- Tag-based grouping via Markdown front matter
- Auto-rendered pages for each article with full metadata
- Full-text search across documents

---

## 🗂 How to Contribute or Extend

New references can be added by placing `.md` files in the `references/` folder.  
Each file should contain appropriate front matter:

```yaml
---
layout: default
title: "Author – Title (Year)"
parent: Foundational
nav_order: 10
---
```

> A future AI agent (MCP-connected) will automate this process: uploading, formatting and structuring new entries.
