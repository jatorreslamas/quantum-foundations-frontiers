# 🧠 Quantum Foundations & Frontiers

This repository reflects my personal journey through the key ideas and turning points in the history of quantum physics. It began when I was 13 years old, studying physics on my own — a curiosity that has grown into a lifelong exploration. Each paper included here shaped the way we understand the quantum world — and continues to inspire new questions.

📂 Each article includes:
- A structured reference with title, authors, and source link
- A summary to contextualize the contribution
- Tags and categories for thematic navigation
